Adds an innocuous revolver to the world, craftable everywhere vanilla revolvers can be crafted, that causes SEVERE hunger, and sends the target into a feeding frenzy!
The HungerGun has a pretty good chance to hit when up close, but still decent at max range. No damage, and slight knockback are also features of this weapon.
Other factions can spawn with this weapon, and have an increased chance to do so. (to make it feel like a threat)

I may at some point add some more types of HungerGuns, and maybe even some art, but for now, this is it. :)
This is my first mod! Sorry for any bugs. I just wanted to learn how to mod RimWorld, and decided to make a gun that causes hunger. Enjoy!
