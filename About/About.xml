Adds an innocuous revolver, shotgun, and bolt-action rifle to the world, craftable everywhere vanilla weapons can be crafted, that causes SEVERE hunger, and sends the target into a feeding frenzy!

HungerGuns Added:
- The HungerGun Revolver has a pretty good chance to hit when up close, but still decent at max range.
- The HungerGun Shotgun has less effective range than a vanilla shotgun, but crazy stopping power.
- The HungerGun Bolt-Action Rifle has similar stats to that of a vanilla Bolt-Action Rifle.

* No damage, and slight knockback are also features of these weapons.
* Mod option to set the percentage chance that hunger will strike on-hit.

Other factions can spawn with these weapons, and have an increased chance to do so. (to make them feel like a threat)

I may at some point add some more types of HungerGuns, and maybe even some art, but for now, this is it. :)
This is my first mod! Sorry for any bugs. I just wanted to learn how to mod RimWorld, and decided to make a gun that causes hunger. Enjoy!
